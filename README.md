# beta-1.8.1-server-and-JRE
use this to make plugins or set up an beta 1.8.1 server.
Most of the time to setup plugins you will need this, and since its beta 1.8.1 JAVA 6 or 7 you can use java 8 but its not advised.

You should always use the compiler at java 6 and use an older version of eclipse to use that. 


If it doesn't work it's likely that you messed up on the YML or the exporting shit. Nothing to serious.
